Hello, 

This is the AWSBOX Reaper. This is your *FINAL* warning that your AWSBOX: 

  ==INSTANCE_NAME==

is going to be terminated. 

If you would like to extend the life of your AWSBOX please run this command: 

  > awsbox spare ==INSTANCE_ID==

and I will let it live for a little while longer. 


If this AWSBOX should NEVER be shutdown please run this command: 

  > awsbox NOKILL ==INSTANCE_ID==

and I will ignore it forever.

If you do not need it anymore please ignore this warning. 

Thank you. 

AWSBOX Reaper.
